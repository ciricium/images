Hi, please read everything below. 
I know it sucks having to do legal stuff but just skim it at least. you can read it more thoroughly if you plan to do anything with my art other than look


guidelines:\n
I dont care what you do with my artworks as long as you state I made them and you arent making money from it.
if you arent sure if I would allow you to do something specific then don't do it, common sense you know?
also, I don't even know how you would but don't commit crimes with any art

examples:
what you can do:
review my artworks (even though they suck) as long as you credit me
use them for personal use e.g. wallpapers, posters etc (as long as you aren't selling or distributing without my permission)
print one out and sniff lines on it (as long as that's legal in your area and you are being safe OBVIOUSLY. I'm not liable for your crimes)

what you can't do:
sell my artworks in any way without explicit permission from me via email. the only official email i have is ciricium1@gmail.com
claim my artworks as you own or by anyone other than me
not crediting me when mentioning my art
be stupid
try to find a loophole to these rules, they are guidelines and I will enforce them at my own digression

if you don't follow the above guidelines I may (in order of least to most severe cases):
send you an email politely asking to stop
contact any social media companies regarding taking down the offending content
persue legal actions

moral of the story:
just be sensible, common sense prevails most times
these are guidelines and arent exhaustive
if you arent sure about something then you can email me at ciricium1@gmail.com (just be aware ciricium is my alt so I may take a while to actually see your email)
I don't really mind you doing personal stuff with my art


finally, the fun part:
sorry you had to read all that legal stuff, i'm covering all bases here
thank you for going to my github to look at my art, I am trying to improve all the time (hopefully)
If i keep going at the rate I am then I may even make a patreon, I dont trust my own dedication for that yet tho
